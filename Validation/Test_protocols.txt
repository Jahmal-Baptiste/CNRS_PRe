Inspired by: Sensory stimulation shifts visual cortex from synchronous to asynchronous states

    Measured quantity:
    - Vm-LFP correlation
    - Vm-LFP coherence

    Protocol:
    The paper makes light of two states in the primary visual cortex of monkeys:
    - asynchronous (irregular spiking due to gaussian current input to the neurons keeping their Vm close to the threshold level)
        corresponds to a visual stimulus
    - low-activity state (scarce input of correlated input leading to rare spike firing)
        corresponds to absence of stimulus
    The correlation and coherence are state-specific (specifically the low frequencies for the coherence)
    The data provided by this paper is only usable with a sinusoidal stimulus of 4 Hz


Inspired by: Gamma-Phase Shifting in Awake Monkey Visual Cortex

    Measured quantity:
    - Spike-LFP phase-locking value
    (- Spike phase, to relate to the spike density)

    Protocol:
    Plot of the Spike-LFP PLv (Phase-Locking value) for network sollicitated with visual stimuli (from 0,25 Hz to 6 Hz)
    All of the neurons are stimulated
    Simulation of 2 s, sampled into 0,1 ms:
    - first second of fixation of blank screen (scarce high correlation stimulations)
    - second second of sinusoidal stimulation
    Recording from 250 ms after the stimulus onset
    Fixed number of spikes taken into consideration
    Moreover, bootstrapping procedure (random selection of spikes without replacement)
    Window of 150 ms to each spike triggered LFP FT (Fourier Transform)

Unfortunately I do not have access to the full document yet)

    Measured quantity:
    - Trial-to-trial reliability of LFP phase
    
    Protocol:
    (I guess I'll see that later because I want to write the spike-LFP PLv script for now)
